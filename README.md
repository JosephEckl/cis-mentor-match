# cis-mentor-match

This site was created as a capstone group project for a web development course.
It matched upperclassmen with underclassmen as part of a mentor/student match initiative within the department.
I hosted the site with my employer at the time. Unfortunately, the backup of the site itself was lost on their behalf.
It was built, functioned well, and was presented and delivered to the department chair, where it was well recieved.
The site was built with WordPress and several plugins that were customized to meet project requirements.
Available here are the wireframes and ERD of the site from the middle of its development.
